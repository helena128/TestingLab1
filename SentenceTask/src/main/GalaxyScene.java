 * The main class where everything happens:
 *
 * Out of the utter blackness stabbed a sudden point of blinding light.
 * It crept up by slight degrees and spread sideways in a thin crescent blade,
 * and within seconds two suns were visible, furnaces of light, searing the black edge
 * of the horizon with white fire.
 * Fierce shafts of colour streaked through the thin atmosphere beneath them
 *
 * Tough task, heh
